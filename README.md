# Browser-Based Visualization of Neutrino Event Topologies

##  Browser-Based Visualization of Interesting Neutrino Event Topologies with JS and HTML

While histograms are useful for handling numeric values, visualizing decays and trajectory paths becomes almost essential for understanding the interactions. 

In this project, we developed a program to model these interactions, with the primary goal of reconstructing the CERN Open Data OPERA electronic detector display (ED). This visualization of topologies is crucial for comprehending how the registered (or targeted) tau neutrino interactions appear.

Although the OPERA experiment recorded a total of 19,905 neutrino interactions, only 10 of these were confirmed as τ leptons [7]. In 2018, OPERA announced the discovery of ντ appearance in a muon neutrino beam, with a significance of 6.1 σ [8].
